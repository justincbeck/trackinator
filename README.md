# Trackinator

This gem, when used correctly, will import a Google spreadsheet
into YouTrack as tickets.  The spreadsheet is a test plan which
defines features (and how to use them).  There are numerous
benefits to this approach:

- Scope is defined up front which reduces scope creep
- Creating the test plan forces developers to be appropriately familiar
  with the project
- A test plan is written up front (TDD at a macro level)

The format of the spreadsheet is as follows (columns can be in any order):

####project (required)
The abbreviation for the project in YouTrack.  The project must
exist in YouTrack already, this gem will not create the project for you

####id (required)
Similar to a version number.  Must be unique in this test plan.  Follows
the format x.y.z (this example is 3 levels deep) and there is no limit
to nesting depth.  Each level denotes sub-tickets that will be created
and associated to the level above.

####type
"Story" for top level items, "Features" and "Tasks" for items one or more
levels below "Story".  “Features” are user facing and "Tasks" are
implementation details.  "Tasks" will not be acceptance tested. Defaults to "bug"

####subsystem (required)
This is one of iOS, Android, Backend

####summary (required)
A one-line summarizing of the feature.

####description (required)
A description of the feature including steps to use the feature.

####outcome (required)
The expected outcome if the feature is used per the steps in the description.

####notes
Any additional notes (which will show up as a comment) that might be useful
for the developer or tester.

####design reference
A reference to the design document.  The format should be wf/c-<page>-<screen
(or range)>.  E.g. wf-12-5 or c-9-2-3 (where "wf" refers to wireframe and "c"
refers to composition)

####priority
One of Low, Normal, High, Show-stopper
